;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides a way to access buffers and window
;; configurations with URLs.  Burly URLs have a scheme like
;; "emacs+burly+TYPE:".  A few different TYPEs are supported, but
;; users needn't write URLs manually, so most won't need to know the
;; details (and Burly URLs can be very long strings of percent-encoded
;; characters, making them human-unreadable anyway).

;; A buffer's URL records the location of the buffer's file (when
;; applicable) and the location within the buffer (when possible).

;; A window configuration's URL records a frame's window configuration
;; (number of windows, sizes, splitting, etc) and the URLs of the
;; buffer in each window.

;; When a URL is opened with Burly, the buffer and/or buffers are
;; restored.  This makes it possible to serialize a set of buffers and
;; windows into a string and access it again later with that string.

;; Burly makes use of bookmark.el to save and restore buffers, and for
;; most cases, it's sufficient.  However, if the
;; `bookmark-make-record-function' for a buffer's major mode isn't
;; satisfactory, it can be overridden by writing custom functions and
;; configuring them in `burly-mode-map'.  For example, the default
;; configuration has special support for Org mode buffers so that
;; narrowed and indirect buffers are restored to the proper subtree
;; (the org-bookmark-heading package also provides this through the
;; Emacs bookmark system, but users may not have it installed, and the
;; functionality is too useful to not include here).

;; Thanks to HIROSE Yuuji [yuuji>at<gentei.org] for writing revive.el,
;; parts of which make the window configuration functionality in this
;; package possible (see burly-revive.el in this package, and
;; <http://www.gentei.org/~yuuji/software/euc/revive.el>).
